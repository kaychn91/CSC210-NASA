		<p>  The 2016 World Championships for League of Legends has come to a close in what could possibly be the most intense finale a player could ask her. With two strong victories in a row, it seemed like SKT would sweep Samsung Galaxy in a seamless victory. </p>

		<p>The League of Legends World Championship final became an instant classic as the first Worlds final to go five games, and SK Telecom T1 defeated the rebuilt and remodeled Samsung Galaxy for their second straight Summoner's Cup and their third title in four years.</p>

		<p>The matchup started in an SKT rout, but Samsung Galaxy clawed back and pushed the set to the full distance. In the end, the paper matchup favorite won and the upstarts lost; once again, Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok emerged triumphant with another victory on his resume and a share of the $5 million purse.</p>

		<p>SKT dominated the first half of the grand final, taking down Game 1 in 54:37 minutes with a grinding pace and a bend-but-do-not-break defensive style that prevented any real potential for a comeback. Faker was a monster on Orianna in terms of teamfighting, damage output, and playmaking. SKT, as a team, prioritized better trades in objectives, split push, base damage and damage-dealer targets in teamfights. In Game 2, reactionary rotations benefited Faker, Bae "Bang" Jun-sik and Lee "Duke" Ho-Seong's early-game farm and itemization. The snowball from the rotational kills and higher farm led to an easy 31:26 minute game.</p>
